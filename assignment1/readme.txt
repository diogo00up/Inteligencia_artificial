In order to run our project, there are two options:
    run proj.py for a terminal based game;
    run graphics.py for a pygame based game;

For this it's needed to have python version 3.10 or newer.
It's also needed to have the pygame, colorama, numpy libraries installed.

On proj.py you need to select a mode by typing a integer from 1 to 4.
In case of a mode, in which you also play, you can select a piece by typing its x and y coordinates and the desired direction.

On graphics.py you need to select a mode, and then if needed select one or two algorithms.
In case of a mode, in which you also play, you can select a piece by clicking on it and then choose from one directions.
